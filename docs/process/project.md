# Process facts: walkingkangaroo.com

Everything `/do`, `/shape` and `/retro` need to know about this project. Edit it here, in this
project. The skills, agents and scripts under `.claude/` come from `process-template` and are
never edited here.

## Identity

- **Linear:** team Dev, project **Website**
- **Repo:** `C:\dev\website`, remote `walkingkangaroo/website` (public)
- **Shell:** Git Bash from the Bash tool.

## Read before planning

- `docs/brief.md`: what the site is, the projects it shows, and the plan. Binding.
- The B2 · Daylight board on https://claude.ai/artifact/RoieMJiNMKNuXoEvUmwK5y: the design.
  Read it with the Artifact tool, never by fetching the URL.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` and the records in `docs/decisions/` that touch the issue's area.

## What green means

Run by the orchestrator, by the implementer before it reports, and by the reviewer if it wants.
Until the first build issue sets up the site, there is nothing to run.

1. `pnpm build`: completes with no errors.
2. `pnpm check`: 0 errors, 0 warnings.

Baseline: run these once before changing anything.

## Looking at the result

- Start the dev server with `preview_start` (add it to `.claude/launch.json`), then check the
  page with `read_page` and screenshots at desktop and phone width (`resize_window` mobile).
- Send Grant screenshots of any visual change with `SendUserFile`.
- Only Grant can judge whether copy sounds like him and whether the design feels right.

## Extra checks by area

- **Anything visual:** check at 390 px wide; no horizontal scroll; text contrast 4.5:1.
- **The GitHub Pages workflow or `CNAME`:** read the workflow run with `gh run view`; the live
  site must still load after merge.

## Model table

| Task | Agent | Model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Small or mechanical work: copy edits, a new content file, asset copies | `implementer` | `haiku` or `sonnet` |
| Most issue work: pages, components, layout, content collections | `implementer` | `sonnet` |
| Hard problems: the deploy pipeline, tricky layout or performance | `implementer` | `opus` |
| Review of any diff | `reviewer` | `sonnet`; `opus` when the diff touches a risky area or anything you'd call risky |

## Parallel rule

Parallel implementers only with disjoint files; otherwise one after another. One checkout, no
worktrees: the repo is small.

## CI

The GitHub Pages deploy workflow, once it exists. Read a failure with
`gh run view <id> --log-failed`.

## Risky areas

Diffs here get an `opus` review, and their issues are `Risk: high`.

- The deploy workflow and anything that changes what is published
- DNS instructions given to Grant (MX records must never change)

## Files that never change without their own issue

- `.github/workflows/*`
- `public/CNAME`

## Who decides

- Grant, for everything. Copy in his voice, which projects are shown and their stages are his
  calls: draft, mark it for him to check, never invent facts.

Decisions are recorded in `docs/decisions/` with a row in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

## Hold-out milestone

Backlog.

## Rules for implementers

- Copy brand assets from the brand pack unchanged; never edit logo files.
- No secrets in the repo: it is public.
- Never put bracketed placeholder text live without Grant's sign-off on the replacement.

## Stray files to check for

- `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.astro/`, `.env*`
- Large media: images over 500 KB or clips over 5 MB need a reason in the pull request.

## Extra stop-and-ask conditions

- Anything that would change DNS, email, or the GitHub Pages settings outside the repo.
