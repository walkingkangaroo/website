# Tidies up after pull requests that merged while no session was watching them.
# Run by the SessionStart hook in .claude/settings.json; safe to run by hand.
# Comes from process-template and is the same in every project. Don't edit it in a project.
#
# Reads two facts from docs/process/project.env:
#   DEFAULT_BRANCH  main or master. Falls back to origin/HEAD, then main, then master.
#   WORKING_COPY    checkout or worktree. Falls back to worktree, the careful mode.
#
# For each local feature/*, shape/* and retro/* branch whose PR is merged on GitHub:
#   - keep it if its tip isn't exactly the commit the PR merged (there's unmerged work)
#   - checkout mode: if it's the current branch and the tree is clean, switch to the default
#     branch first; keep it if the tree has uncommitted changes
#   - worktree mode: the main checkout is shared with other live sessions, so never switch
#     branches and never remove a worktree
#   - either mode: keep it if it's checked out in any worktree (a session may still be there)
#   - otherwise delete it, and its remote branch if GitHub kept it and no open PR is based on it
# Then fast-forward the default branch where that is safe. Prints a summary only when it did
# something; the hook adds that to Claude's context so the session can finish the rest of the
# Cleanup phase.
